# Countdown Number Game

Chernyang: This has been a promise for a while, and I wish to announce that we will hold a coding challenge in the first quarter of 2022. 
The topic this time round is Countdown Number Game. 
For those who never watched Countdown, [here is an “extraordinary” example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0q6PT4ad6BY&ab_channel=8ertie).

## WHAT IS THE CHALLENGE
So here is the coding challenge, each participant (or team) needs to do two parts

### Question bank generator
The requirement is simply to generate x many random large numbers (25, 50, 75 or 100) and 6-x many random small numbers (from 1 till 10) for any given x, and to generate a 3 digit number that all these 6 numbers can generate by using operators +, -, *, / and each number precisely once.

### Solver
Given 6 numbers and the 3-digit outcome number, solve this by using all 6 numbers each once with simple arithmetic operations : +, -, * and /.

## WHAT TO EXPECT ONCE I PARTICIPATE
This is a challenge for you to enjoy during your own time or using your self-study time.
Please register your interest as soon as you have so by replying all in this email chain. 
I will hold a kick start meeting in late January (26th) to explain the detail of the rules. 
All the participants and the judges will gather near month end (Feb, March) to share and learn each others’ up to date solutions, 
measuring both the speed & randomness of each question bank generator and the speed and accuracy of each Solver. 
Every participant can copy the any key implementations of others during these two sessions.

    The final meeting will be held in the month end of April, 
    when and where we gave the final testing results of all solutions.

    We highly encourage pairing participation 
    (at most 2 ppl per participation unit, and strict rule for distinct squad)

## JUDGING AND PRIZES
Michael, Nico, Saji, Jack and I have agreed to form the base of the judging panel and our responsibility is organise these meetups, 
measuring and validating the runs of each participant’s code, identifying efficient, smart designs or breakthrough implementations to recommend everyone else.

We will have prizes in 4 categories: (all to be decided on the April end meeting) and the prizes will be like what you would expect from winning a hackday

* **Best generator**: by how quick and random the question bank can be generated
* **Best solver**: by how quick the solver is
* **Innovative Champion**: Whose ideas have been most adopted by other teams
* **All rounder champion**: Either to be decided by the judges, or being the winner of an organise a knockout tournament*

## KNOCKOUT TOURNAMENT
We will hold a cricket like knockout tournament if we have enough teams/participants which completed both Generator and Solver. 
Generator is the baller side, and the Solver is the Batter side, and the game is for 100 balls/questions. 
We will calculate the total diff of the time spent, and reverse the role of the Baller and Batter. 
The team that uses the least time win and progress. 
The outright winner will be our overall champion.
